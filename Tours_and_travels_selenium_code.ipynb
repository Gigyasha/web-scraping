      "OVERVIEW After breakfast head out for local sightseeing of Leh. Start with a visit to Hall of Fame, a museum constructed by the Indian Army in memory of the brave Indian soldiers who laid down their lives defending the motherland in the Indo-Pak wars. It stands as a reminder of the great sacrifices made by our soldiers to ensure the safety and security of our country. Then visit Gurudwara Pathar Sahib, a beautiful Sikh Temple built in 1517 to commemorate the visit to the Ladakh region of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder Guru of the Sikh faith. Then take a stop at Magnetic Hill, a \"Cyclops hill\" or Gravity hill located near Leh. The layout of the area and surrounding slopes create an amazing optic illusion. The hill road is actually a downhill road. Objects and cars on the hill road may appear to roll uphill in defiance of gravity when they are, in fact, rolling downhill. After that visit Sangam (the confluence of Zanskar & Indus rivers), a very picturesque site. You could try an adventurous rafting on the river. Afterwards visit Alchi Monastery, built between 958 and 1055 CE. The artistic and spiritual details of both Buddhism and the Hindu kings of that time in Kashmir are reflected in the wall paintings in the monastery complex. The complex also has huge statues of the Buddha and lavish wood carvings and art-work — almost baroque in style. Reach back Leh by evening and visit Shanti Stupa, a Buddhist white-domed stupa on a hilltop in Chanspa. It was built in 1991 by Japanese Buddhist Bhikshu, Gyomyo Nakamura and part of the Peace Pagoda mission. Dinner & overnight stay will be at hotel in Leh.  Meals: Breakfast & Dinner\n",

Upon arrival you will be transferred to your hotel where the remainder of the day is yours at leisure to acclimatise. Framed by the jagged snow-capped Himalayas, the city itself sits on the historic Silk Road. Dotted with humbling monasteries, stupas and crumbling mud houses, this enchanting city is very easy to fall in love with. Leh is located at just over 3500m, and it is not uncommon to suffer from a little altitude sickness, whether it be a headache, breathlessness or dizziness. Be sure to drink lots of ginger tea, remain well hydrated and remember, no strenuous exercise while acclimatising. (B,L,D) Overnight at Hotel Singee Palace or similar\n",
      "TITLE - 5: Leh\n",
      "OVERVIEW We have allowed two more days in Leh to acclimatise before starting your trek. If you are feeling up to it, you can participate in some conservation work in local schools, supporting the work done by the Snow Leopard Conservancy Trust.  This includes assisting with environmental education, research, campaigns and direct action. This program works in conjunction with a handful of Government schools and was founded on the belief that a country can develop meaningfully only if ecological sustainability and social equity are guaranteed. Over these two day, you will also be able to visit Shanti Stupa, Leh Palace as well as some of the local monasteries. Shanti Stupa is 5km from town and overlooks Leh city, offering a panaoromic view of the surrounding snow capped mountains. The location of Shanti Stupa is visible from all over Leh city. Leh Palace, though in a dilapidated condition, is full of old worldly charm, and the adventurous journey one has to undertake to reach the palace makes it even more special. Built in the 17th century by King Singe Namgyal as the royal residence, it was deserted in the mid 19th century after the family shifted to Stok. A visit here for many people feels like a glimpse into the window of Tibet. (B,L,D) Overnight at Hotel Singee Palace or similar\n",

      "OVERVIEW In and around RumbakThis morning after breakfast you will drive an hour to the entrance to the Hemis National Park. From the road end it is a short hike on a good trail for an hour or two to our base camp in the park. Hemis is home to a number of rare species including the bharal, and of course the snow leopard, and has been identified as a Snow Leopard reserve under a project launched by the Central Government aimed at conserving the species, its prey base and its fragile mountainous home. Base camp is where you will have your dining, kitchen, toilet, bathing, and sleeping tents (dome tents). Your cook and helpers also stay at base camp and provide you with freshly cooked breakfasts and dinners daily in the dining tent. For breakfast, you can expect an array of food; eggs made to order, pancakes, cereal (corn flakes and porridge), local bread, butter, jam, marmalade, juice, coffee & tea. Lunch is packed every day for you. Dinner is a 4 or 5 course meal every night, made up of a variety of sumptuous Indian, Continental, Chinese, Tibetan, and Ladakhi food.  Accommodation here is rustic and basic.

      "TITLE - 12: Hemis National Park\n",
      "OVERVIEW You will have five full days to trek and explore the National Park. Distances covered and the level of activity will depend on wildlife sightings and how strenuous you wish to make the trek. You are likely to see signs of the snow leopard, as winter is the time that they descend to lower elevations. If you are lucky, you may see one perched high on the rocks or balanced effortlessly on a sheer vertical ridge. Snow leopard sightings are a game of patience. Your schedule on these days is subject to previous sightings of the snow leopards, and your guide will collect information from locals and other guides on a daily basis to determine the movement of your day. You will either follow on from the previous day’s route, or trek and explore nearby areas, waiting and watching for the gracious Snow Leopards using a scope. The moment you witness these beautiful and elegant cats, your breath will be taken away. Everything will seem silent as you watch, captivated by their beauty. Soft padding paws, brush like powerful tails. Every move planned and executed with precision. This will truly be one of the most awe inspiring moments of your journey. Watch as they scavenge and search for prey. Camouflaged so perfectly into the snow covered rocky terrain. The only sounds to be heard are your gasps of amazement and the click of camera shutters. You will never forget this moment. Although Snow Leopards are the main attraction, Hemis National Park is also home to blue sheep, argali (a large horned sheep), numerous mountain and migratory birds, as well as an occasional Tibetan wolf. At the end of each day, you will return to camp for some warm food and hot tea and exchange tales of your sightings. (B,L,D) Overnight Base Camp – Hemis National Park\n",

Delhi - India’s capital and a major gateway to the country, contemporary Delhi is a bustling metropolis, which successfully combines in its fold the ancient and the modern. Its strategic location was one of the prime reasons why successive dynasties chose it as their seat of power. It is not surprising then that what constitutes Delhi today, is a conglomerate of seven cities. Down the ages the region in and around modern Delhi saw Lalkot built in the mid-11th century, Siri established by Allauddin Khilji, Tughlakabad, and Ferozabad built by the Tughlaks followed by the city of the Lodis and then came Shahjahanabad, capital of the Mughals under Shah Jahan.  New Delhi reflects the legacy the British left behind, the distinction between the capitals of the British and the Mughals respectively. But wherever the visitor goes he will invariably confront the city’s past.﻿ You discover Old Delhi also known as Shahjahanabad. It was built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, who also built the Taj Mahal. Walk on foot or aboard a cycle-rickshaw Kinari Bazar, Chandni Chowk & Kari Baoli rickshaw. Explore the dried fruit market as well as the spice market, which is a wholesale market. Admire the Great Mosque (Jama Masjid).   From here you proceed to visit New Delhi, en-route photo stop at Red Fort of Delhi, Gandhi Memorial at Rajghat, drive past India Gate and visit President's house and other government buildings from outside. Later in the day you will visit the Humayun's Tomb or the tomb of Emperor Humayun which was built at the request of his wife in 1565. It is made of red sandstone and white marble. The tomb is placed on a huge platform. It is surrounded by beautiful gardens and Qutab Minar, which boasts an elegant minaret.

      "OVERVIEW Today we visit Sankar Gompa (monastery). Nestled amid the shimmering poplar trees and terraced fields of barley that extend up the valley behind Leh, Sankar Gompa is among the most accessible monasteries in central Ladakh. This gompa belongs to the Gelukpa order and houses a beautiful impression of the Buddhist deity, Avolokiteshwara Padmahari with a thousand arms and heads. The hill here offers excellent views of Leh, parts of the Indus River Valley and the imposing 6100 m (20,100 ft) high peak of Stok Kangri that overlooks Leh. Nearby is the Peace Stupa on a hill commanding superb views of the town and the Indus Valley.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later we will visit Leh Palace. This captivating building rises from the edge of a hill overlooking the town. Built in the 17th century, Leh Palace was occupied by the Ladakhi royal family until the 1830's. Today the building is deserted and is being restored by UNESCO. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our next stop today is Shey Palace, the old 'summer palace' of the kings of Ladakh, built over 350 years ago by Lhachen Palgyigon, the first king of Ladakh. It stands next to the remains of a larger construction on the east side of a hill, which runs southeast towards the Indus. From the palace you can see over the fertile Indus plain northeast to Tikse Gompa and over the Indus to the Zanskar mountain range.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some point during our time in the Leh area, we will have a jeep tour up the hairpins of the Nubra Valley road to the Khardung La Pass (5470 m/18,400 feet) -- the highest vehicular accessible pass in the world (inaccessible in spring due to snow). The views of the Zanskar Range and the Indus Valley on the way up are amazing as are frequent sightings of yaks on the high pastures below the pass. The road to the pass that crosses the Ladakh Range and provides access to the Nubra Valley and the Karakoram region was built at great human and financial cost by the Indian Army following frequent incursions into the area by the Chinese Army following the occupation of Tibet in the late 1950's. \n",

Founded in the 11th century by Rinchen Zhangpo, one of the early Tibetan preachers who spread Lamaistic Buddhism to this part of the world, Alchi is undergoing major restoration work under UN sponsorship. The 1000-year-old paintings inside the main temple are some of the oldest of their kind and quite distinct from the murals present in the later built gompas.\n",

Hidden behind a screen of trees around 2km south of the palace, Stok's small monastery has some crumbling old stupas, but the dominant feature, 200m above, is its brand-new gilded Buddha that is visible from most of the village. As we enter the veranda of the monastery, we come across bright friezes depicting the Guardians of the Four Directions. One of the major attractions of the Stok Monastery is its library, which boasts a complete set of the Kandshur, the 108 volumes of the Buddha's teachings. \n",

      "Thimphu is a bustling developing city/town with little cafes, bookshops and handicraft shops lined along its streets. The main town center itself is just a small area, and it lends itself well to individual exploration as it is easy to walk around and navigate.

      "OVERVIEW Today we drive to the impressive Tashicho Dzong (which we may be allowed to enter), the traditional summer capital of Bhutan and now the seat of the Bhutanese government. The present building is a rebuilt version of a dzong or \tmonastery-fortress that was erected here by Nawang Namgyal in 1641 and it retains many of the features of the old dzong. It is now an impressive sight and it houses all the government deparments and ministries, the throne room of the King, the National Assembly chambers and the nation's largest monastery with over 2,000 monks in residence.\n",
      "\n",
      "OUR DEPARTURE coincides with the Thimphu Tsechu, an annual festival held at the Tashi Chhodzong. The Tsechu reflects the deeply rooted religious sentiments of the people.

      "\n",
      "Today's journey takes us deep into the heart of Bhutan. The drive will give you an insight into a medieval way of life that has changed little over the centuries. Modern development has brought better education, health care and electricity to these remote areas but the local small farm-based economy that has kept the local people self sufficient over the years is largely unchanged. Located at a relatively low altitude of 1300 m (4,265 feet) in a rainshadow, the Punakha Valley produces most of the oranges and fruits grown commercially in Bhutan. Despite the warmer climate and the possibility of growing an endless variety of produce, the population of the valley remains remarkably low. Until very recently, Punakha remained the winter capital of Bhutan (there is only one capital now, Thimphu), and it is still the winter headquarters of the Head Abbott (Je Khempo) and his monks who move here every winter. \n",
      "\n",
      "Upon reaching Punakha we will visit the Punakha Dzong, arguably the most beautiful dzong in the country! The magnificent Punakha dzong straddles an island in the confluence of the Pho Chu and Mo Chhu (male and female tributaries of the river). This dzong was the second to be built in Bhutan and it served as the capital and seat of government until the mid-1950s. All of Bhutan's kings have been crowned here. The dzong is still the winter residence of the dratshang (official monk body). Today the dzong has been magnificently restored to befit its status in Bhutan’s history. \n",

      "OVERVIEW Today we travel by road back to Paro, set in what is considered to be the most beautiful of the main valleys (2280 m / 7,500 feet). The dominant feature of Paro is undoubtedly the Paro Dzong set above the glacial Paro Chu River. It is a particularly important and historic dzong having played a part in Bhutan's history since it was first constructed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Paro is a thriving agricultural valley and is also the location of some of the holiest Buddhist sites in Bhutan. Before the construction of roads most of Bhutan's trade came through Paro either from Tibet via Tremo la or from the south via Haa. Paro Valley extends from Jumolhari on the Tibetan border to Chuzom which is the confluence of the Thimphu and Punakha rivers. \n",
      "\n",
      "The town is an interesting mix of traditional architecture interspersed with handicraft stores, cafes and galleries. This morning we can stroll and explore the growing town. The town is situated below the Dzong, which overlooks the valley and is accessible via a traditional cantilever bridge. Near the bridge are chortens (prayer shrines) situated alongside the Ugyen Pelri palace. We will also visit the local monastery situated at one end of the town. If we are lucky we may be able to view an archery match as the local archery field is at the end of the town en route to the Ugyen Pelri Palace. \n",

      "\n",
      "We will enjoy a visit to the Paro National Museum, situated above the Dzong in the ancient watchtower (at time of writing the exhibits are being viewed in an adjoining building as the tower is under repairs). Housed in a 17th Century watchtower, the museum has a unique character and beautiful panoramic views over Paro Valley. Opened in 1968, its collection of fine arts, paintings and bronzes are famous. Here we will also find displays of textiles, jewellery, and handicrafts. The top floor of the museum is a chapel containing a \"tree\" depicting the main figures of the four religious schools of Tibetan Buddhism.

Kathmandu’s Durbar Square was where the city’s kings were once crowned and legitimised, and from where they ruled. The Durbar Sq area is actually made up of three loosely linked squares, and the area also includes the Royal Palace with its gilded gates and elaborate statues. The square is alive with a multitude of nationalities, intermingled with stalls displaying a wide variety of Nepalese and Tibetan handicrafts.\n",
      "\n",
      "We then proceed to Swayambhunath Temple, Nepal's most significant centre of Buddhist worship. A journey up to the Buddhist temple and UNESCO World Heritage Site of Swayambhunath is one of the definitive experiences of Kathmandu. There has been a temple on this site since at least the 5th century. Swayambhunath  is also known as the \"Monkey Temple\" due to the large population of monkeys that make the grounds their home. The temple buildings are set atop a hill and offer an excellent view of Kathmandu and its valley.\n",

Founded in the 12th century, Bhaktapur is filled with Hindu and Buddhist religious sites and art. The tragic earthquake of 2015 caused terrible devastation, with whole streets of traditional houses lost to the disaster.

      "In addition to a walking tour of Bhaktapur, we will explore some other sites in the Kathmandu Valley. Pashupatinath is perhaps the most important Hindu temple in Nepal, and one of the most important Shiva temples on the subcontinent. This temple draws numerous devotees from all over India each year. Bouddhanath is among the largest stupas in South Asia, and it has become the focal point of Tibetan Buddhism in Nepal. The white mound looms thirty-six meters overhead. The stupa is located on the ancient trade route to Tibet, and Tibetan merchants rested and offered prayers here for many centuries. When refugees entered Nepal from Tibet in the 1950s, many of them decided to live around Bouddhanath. They established many gompas, and the \"Little Tibet\" of Nepal was born. This \"Little Tibet\" is still the best place in the Valley to observe Tibetan lifestyle. Monks walk about in maroon robes. Tibetans walk with prayer wheels in their hands, and the rituals of prostration are presented to the Buddha as worshippers circumambulate the stupa on their hands and knees, bowing down to their lord.\n",

Pilgrims from across Tibet, many of whom have walked hundreds of kilometres to see the Jokhang once in their lives, line up for hours in order to enter the temple and perform a ritual circuit in prostration of its many sacred shrines. It is a moving experience to join them in the dark hallways, filled with the sound of low chanting, lit only by butter lamps. The main image worshipped here is Jowo Rinpoche, a gilded statue of Buddha Sakyamuni said to have been modeled during his lifetime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jokhang is encircled by the Barkhor, an 800m (2,645 feet) flagstone pathway that is both a sacred circumambulation route and the biggest bazaar in all of Tibet. Night and day, Tibetans walk clockwise around it, earning religious merit as they shop, people-watch and chat with friends. Here you find people from all corners of Tibet: striking, tall Khampa men from the east with big knives and red tassels wrapped about their heads; Golok women with their hair plaited in 108 tiny braids; nomad families bundled in sheepskins.

      "This afternoon we will visit Sera Monastery, one of the most important Gelugpa (Yellow Hat sect) monasteries. Located at the foot of Tatipu Hill in the northern suburb of Lhasa City, Sera Monastery is one of three famous monasteries in the city along with the Drepung Monastery and the Ganden Monastery. This monastery is the location of the famous ‘monk's debate' which takes place on some afternoons during the week. During this ritual 'question and answer' session, a senior monk quizzes a junior and there is much grimacing, clapping and mock threatening. The important part of this ritual is the passing on of knowledge of the theosophical questions of the Tibetan lamaistic Buddhist faith. Though it seems pretty entertaining to the visitor, the debate rituals are serious business \n",

      "\n",
      "As we continue on our way to Shigatse, we will stop and visit Gyantse, famous for its multi-tiered stupa known as the Kumbum. The sprawling compound in the far north of town houses Pelkor Chöde Monastery and the monumental Gyantse Kumbum, a chörten filled with fine paintings and statues. Both are deservedly top of the list on most travellers' must-sees. Palkhor lies at the foot of Dzong Hill, and is well-known for its Kumbum, which has 108 chapels in its four floors.

Having experienced the heat in Delhi, you will have a complete understanding as to why the British moved their summer capital up to this charming little hill station and ran the entire country from up here, where it is pleasantly cooler than down on the plains\n",
      "TITLE Shimla\n",
      "OVERVIEW This morning after a delicious buffet breakfast at our hotel, we drive up to Jakhu temple, which is an ancient temple dedicated to the Hindu deity Hanuman, the Monkey God. It is situated on Jakhu Hill, Shimla's highest peak, 2.5 km east of the Ridge at a height of nearly 2,500 m (over 8,000 ft) above sea level. Although the temple is accessible by foot and cable car, we drive up saving our energy for an afternoon of exploring Shimla and surrounds.\n",

After breakfast we take a morning hike to a nearby village which was shown to us by a local and which has not yet been discovered by other guides and so remains untouched by tourists.  Here we can meet the locals and experience traditional life in the Kullu valley. This is rural mountain India where between the villages we will stroll by apple orchards with stunning views of the valleys and snow capped peaks of the Himalaya.   On the way back to town we will stop at a nice restaurant for a fabulous late lunch.  Back in Manali you also have the opportunity to explore some of the temples around Manali, take a massage, shop in the markets or soak in the hot springs in nearby Vashisht. We will have dinner either at our hotel or at one of the many good restaurants in Manali. (Freshly caught mountain trout should be on the menu!).  We advise that you start taking Diamox (half/morning, half/evening) today in preparation for our ascent to altitude from tomorrow.

      "\n",
      "This is the first major pass on the traverse of the Himalayas, and gets the brunt of the heavy weather (tons of snow in winter!), which gave it the Hindi name “Rohtang” (which literally means “field of corpses”, as when the snow cleared at the beginning of summer, the unfortunate who were trapped in the pass were found!). The road will be relatively snow free at this time of year but is nonetheless a spectacular pass with amazing views on the way up and down. At a mere 4000 metres (13060ft) it is a teeny little pass compared with what lies ahead!\n",
      "\n",
      "We descend from the pass into the Keylong Valley, which is cut off from the outside world for 8 months of the year by the massive snowfalls in the Himalayas. The scenery is just incredible through this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "We arrive at our destination for the night, The Hotel Ibex, where we will have a relaxing drink and dinner. \n",
      "We are at high altitude in the Himalayas, so nightlife options are limited! An early night after dinner is probably the call here!\n",
      "TITLE Sarchu\n",
      "OVERVIEW In and around SarchuOn our second day out of Manali we only have to cover about 86kms, but 86 km through the highest mountains on earth is a full day expedition with mind blowing scenery! We cross Darcha, ZingZing Bar, Suraj Tal and Baralacha La to reach Sarchu. Situated at an altitude of 4890m (16,040 ft), Baralacha La is a high mountain pass in the Zanskar region and lies above the snow line. It will be cold! We will take a break here and walk up a hill alongside the road which will assist us in acclimatization.   After the pass we descend down towards Sarchu. Sarchu lies on the boundary of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir the barren grandeur of this place is similar to the Ladakhi landscape.   We stay at our overnight camp at 4290m (14075ft) at Sarchu, which is only set up from mid May to the end of September because of the snow. We are deep in the Himalaya! It will be cold! The camp provides hot water bottles and plenty of blankets and we will have a hot but simple buffet dinner and unlimited hot tea! At this altitude hydration is extremely important.\n",
      "TITLE Leh\n",
      "OVERVIEW In and around LehDay 10 is the most spectacular day of this drive.  We have breakfast and tea at our camp and then we set off for Leh.  In this surreal almost lunar landscape where the scenery is breathtakingly beautiful in its harshness and austerity, we go  across the More (pronounced Moray) plains where the road has an average elevation of 4800 metres and is flanked by the Himalayan ranges on both sides.   We head over two very high passes, the Lungalacha La (5059m - 16600ft) and the Taglang La (the second highest motorable road in the world) at 5359m (17582ft).   The oxygen levels in the air are very low at this point on account of the altitude, but we will stop at the passes where we can walk short distances to the roadside shrines for photos. You will be breathing very thin air so the secret is to move slowly and breathe often and deeply so as not to overdo it.  And don't forget to drink lots of water. We pass stunning eroded cliffs and mountains before descending down into Ladakh and the capital Leh at 3500m (11483ft). Once down the other side of the Himalayas, the road to Leh is a fairly new blacktop and we should make good time into the ancient mountain city.\n",
      "TITLE Leh\n",
      "OVERVIEW Built in the 1600’s, Hemis Monastery is a stunning Tibetan Buddhist Gompa (one of the largest in Ladakh) famous for its annual festival with ceremonies including music, ceremonial displays and the mystic masked dances or chhams. Chham dances are considered a form of meditation and an offering to the gods, providing merit to anyone who witnesses them. The Hemis Festival commemorates the birth of Guru Padmasambhava who is revered throughout the Himalayan regions as the second Buddha.\n",
      "\n",
      "This morning after breakfast, we travel the 40km to Hemis where the Hemis Festival is underway. We will have reserved seating in a prime position to enjoy the morning ceremonies and dances before grabbing some lunch at the eatery that has been set up for the festival-goers. After lunch we return to Leh, stopping for plenty of photo opportunities on the way.\n",
      "TITLE Nubra Valley\n",
      "OVERVIEW After breakfast at our hotel we set off in a North easterly direction towards the Nubra Valley. We travel directly up out of Leh into the mountains with stunning views of the Leh valley and the Stok mountain range. After about 2 hours we cross over the Khardung La Pass, at 5602m (18380ft), the highest motorable pass in the world. We will stop here for a photo opportunity. There is even a chai wallah at the top of the pass, so those who fancy a taste of the highest chai in the world can do so! We head down from the pass into the remote Nubra Valley with green oasis villages surrounded by stark scree slopes, boulder fields, sand dunes and arid mountains. We stop for lunch at Khardung village which is roughly an hour from the top of the pass.  Part of the old Silk Road between India & China, local communities once prospered as caravans of cloth, spices, gold & gemstones traversed this route.  Tonight we will stay near Diskit, the regional capital of this part of the Nubra.\n",
      "TITLE Nubra Valley\n",
      "OVERVIEW After a leisurely breakfast at the hotel, we visit the 14th century Diskit Monastery, (one of The Dalai Lama`s favourite monasteries - he stays here whenever he visits Ladakh), with its majestic views, old temples and halls and a 32m high statue of the Maitreya Buddha facing down the Shyok river towards Pakistan.  Double-humped Bactrian camels were abandoned here by traders and travelers in the centuries gone by and have thrived. There are now around 200 of these camels and you have the opportunity to take a camel-ride into the Hunder sand dunes.  We also take spend the afternoon on a hike through local villages which are famous for their apricot orchards.\n",
      "TITLE Leh\n",
      "OVERVIEW We head back to Leh, with another drive across the high Khardung La. We will stop for a snack if anyone is famished, but our plan is to push on through to Leh and have a late lunch there.\n",
      "The food here is very Tibetan and completely different to the rest of India, with dishes like Momos and Thukpas.\n",
      "Once checked back into our hotel we are free to spend the afternoon relaxing, or wandering the market in Leh where you’ll find many Tibetan market stalls and Kashmiri shops selling beautiful handicrafts.\n",
      "TITLE Leh\n",
      "OVERVIEW Today we visit the Shanti Stupa, built in 1991 by Japanese Buddhist Monk, Gyomyo Nakamura and is part of the Peace Pagoda mission. The stupa offers wonderful views of Leh, the valley and the Stok mountain range. We also visit Leh Palace, recently restored and opened to the public. The Palace is in the centre of town on a hill with commanding views to the markets and streets below. After exploring Leh Palace, we drive to the nearby villages of Shey and Thiksey where we’ll have lunch at a local restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thiksey Monastery is the largest such structure in central Ladakh. Located on a hill slope, its buildings are arranged in an ascending order of importance and are well spaced, from the foot of the hill housing the dwelling units to the top of the hill enshrining the monasteries and potang (official residence) of the chief lama. The monastery strongly resembles the Potala Palace in Lhasa, Tibet, the former official seat of the Dalai Lamas.\n",
      "\n",
      "After Thiksey we explore the Shey Palace and Monastery, built in 1655 as a summer retreat for the Kings of Ladakh while soaking up the beautiful, stark scenery produced by the river flowing through the valley creating a green belt of willow and poplar trees.\n",
      "TITLE Uleytokpo\n",
      "OVERVIEW In and around UleytokpoAnother epic road trip awaits us as we drive west along another scenic Himalayan mountain road. \n",
      "Today is a relatively short drive to Uley with lots of stops enroute. First we stop to view the impressive confluence of the Indus and Zanskar rivers – where the crystal clear blue waters of the Indus merge with the mineral laden brown Zanskar. We stop at charming Nimoo village for morning tea before heading on to explore the Fortress-monastery of Basgo.\n",
      "Basgo was an impregnable monastery/fort that was never conquered. It’s location atop a hill towering over ruins of the ancient town is spectacular. \n",
      "While other monasteries in Ladakh were always built upon a hill, Alchi was hidden in plain sight within the village at ground level, thereby escaping attacks from invaders. Built in the 10th century, the shrines and temples are very different in style from other gompas and the Kashmiri artisans who created wall paintings and sculptures lent their own unique style to the detail in the temples. \n",
      "We will have a late lunch at a restaurant in Alchi before continuing for an hour to our overnight stop at Uleytokpo. Our resort is set on the banks of the Indus river and we can enjoy a spa at the resort and explore the banks of the Indus river.\n",

One of the largest and oldest gompas in Ladakh, Lamayuru has around 150 permanent resident monks. The town and monastery of Lamayuru are situated in what is known as ‘Moonland’ - a series of undulating hills that resemble the surface of the moon - yet again another unique and spectacular landscape. We will stop along the way for a light lunch at our choice of local Dhaba, perhaps at the final outpost of Ladakhi Buddhism, the fascinating Mulbek Buddha statue.\n",
      "We stop the night at Kargil (2676m - 8780ft), the second largest town in Ladakh after Leh, and an ancient town in the area known as Baltistan. Dinner will be at our hotel.\n",

      "OVERVIEW In and around SrinagarAfter breakfast at our hotel, we leave Kargil and head for Srinagar. \n",
      "Srinagar dates back to the 3rd century BC with evidence that Emperor Ashoka built many stupas in the valley. Over the next 2000 years, Buddhist rulers strengthened the Buddhist traditions before the Hindus took over around 960CE. After the 14th century, the city came under the control of several Muslim dynasties, including the Moghals. The Sikh’s also had control over the valley for a period before the British took control and installed Gulab Singh as the Maharajah in the mid 1800’s.\n",
      " \n",
      "After our final mountain drive over the heart-stopping 3528m (11575ft) pass of Zoji La, we descend down into the beautiful, green and lush Kashmir valley, a stark contrast after the barren Ladakhi landscape.\n",

Shoes must be removed, feet washed and heads covered before we can enter (please bring a headscarf with you or buy one outside). The Golden Temple itself is a surprisingly small building surrounded almost entirely by tanks of holy water in which the Sikh pilgrims bathe. The atmosphere is one of incredible calm with devotees taking their turn to pass through the main shrine where there is a continuous and melodic recital (known as the Akhand Path) from the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book. We also visit the nearby Jalianwala Gardens, site of the notorious massacre under General Dyer in 1919 which led to 379 Sikhs being shot from point blank range by British troops.\n",
